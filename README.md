# ORM

## As an e-commerce business owner I want to be able to monitor my inventory using the ORM system

As a developer the motivation for building this project was to streamline the process for e-commerce business 
owners and employees to manage inventory simply.

I developed this project to simplify the inventory process.

This program helps to manage inventory and make things such as when to order
more merchandise, monitoring for theft, and expanding to include new products much easier.

This project taught me about creating a "bridge" between object-oriented programs and relational databases.
